Redesign the 'Social Hub' page for my mobile app, Goon Streak, a gamified habit tracker where users log and share their masturbation streaks with friends. The app should be highly interactive, visually engaging, and feel like a mix between a habit tracker, social media, and a gaming leaderboard.

ðŸ”¹ Design & UI Features:
Smooth, Rounded UI Elements: Use soft shadows, gradient backgrounds, and curved cards to make the UI look premium.

Confetti & Animated Celebrations: When a user breaks a streak record, trigger an on-screen confetti explosion with a funny message.
Live Activity Feed: Show real-time updates of when friends log a streak, unlock a milestone, or complete a challenge.
Friend Reactions: Allow users to send live emoji reactions (ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¦ðŸ¤£ðŸ‘€) when a friend logs a streak.
Friend Streak Battles: Add a "Challenge Mode" where friends compete to maintain streaks for longer.
ðŸ”¹ Interactivity & Engagement Features:
Hype Button: Clicking this sends a motivational meme, voice clip, or funny text to a friend.

Voice Notifications: Enable custom voice alerts for streak milestones (e.g., "New PR! 3 Hours Strong! ðŸ’ª") using funny or serious voices.
Dark Mode Compatibility: Use sleek neon UI elements for dark mode users.
